# Relational Database

This uses sqlite3 for the database.
There is currently only one table to store the inventory of a videostore

# Development Environment

I used python and imported the sqlite3 library.
I primarily used vi but also used Kwrite
# Useful Websites

* [sqlite tutorial](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/)
* [python sqlite](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/sqlite3.html)

# Future Work

* add more tables
* build a more comprehensive interface for those who do not know SQL
